Our config file has the following settings

SEED 12345
INIT_TIME 0
FIN_TIME 50000
ARRIVE_MIN 5
ARRIVE_MAX 50
QUIT_PROB 0.2
NETWORK_PROB 0.3
CPU_MIN 3
CPU_MAX 12
DISK1_MIN 10
DISK1_MAX 50
DISK2_MIN 10
DISK2_MAX 50
NETWORK_MIN 10
NETWORK_MAX 50

The specs gave quit probability, network probability, and arrival time as samples. Next, we set out have at least 1000 job arrivals in our simulation; with a higher sample size, more accurate and reliable statistics will be generated, so we set the duration of the simulation to 50,000. Next we, adjusted the component speeds such that there was not an absolutely massive buildup at each component, but enough of a buildup to see that the statistics (queue max, average, etc.) are working correctly. With these settings, inter arrival time, and duration, we also make it so the events recorded in the log (usually) aren’t coincidentally occurring on the same time unless they are supposed to (compared to a higher speed simulation set at a lower duration).
